# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Project Context

This is a **personal project** created for learning, experimentation, and professional presentation.

It is **not an open collaboration project** in the traditional sense.
However, contributions may be considered if they are:

- relevant
- well-justified
- aligned with the project philosophy

> This document exists to clarify *how* contributions would be evaluated, not to actively solicit them.

---

## Project Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

- clarity over cleverness
- explicit intent over implicit behavior
- maintainability over short-term optimization
- security and accessibility by default

> Any contribution must respect these principles. \
Changes that only improve style, personal preference, or abstraction without clear benefit are discouraged.

---

## Scope of Contributions

### What *may* be welcome

- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Security improvements
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance improvements with measurable impact
- Documentation clarifications
- Educational suggestions with technical justification

### What is *not* welcome

- Framework migrations
- Stylistic rewrites
- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Opinionated changes without objective benefit
- “Drive-by” pull requests

---

## Code Expectations

Any contribution must:

- follow existing architectural patterns
- reuse existing utilities and modules
- respect file and folder organization
- preserve accessibility and security features
- avoid introducing new abstractions unless strictly necessary

> If a change cannot be explained clearly, it is likely not a good fit.

---

## Comments & Documentation

- Comments must be:
  - concise
  - written in English
  - uppercase
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what*
- Obvious code should not be commented

> Refer to `AGENTS.md` for detailed rules.

---

## Review Process

- Not all contributions will be accepted
- Rejection does not imply poor quality
- Decisions are based on project direction and learning goals

> Discussion is welcome. \
Assumptions are not.

---

## Final Notes

This repository reflects how I approach software development:

- thoughtfully
- deliberately
- with long-term perspective

> If you are reviewing this project as a recruiter or fellow learner,
consider this document as a description of how I would work within a team environment.
